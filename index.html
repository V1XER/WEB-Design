        <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b> (<strong>HTML</strong>) is the standard
        markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        <br />
        It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
        assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
        (<strong>CSS</strong>) and scripting languages such as
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
        prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
        documents.<br />
        In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext
        system.<br />
        Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in
        late 1990.<br />
        That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
        collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
        formally adopted by CERN.<br />
        In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many
        areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first
        entry.<br /><br />
        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called
        "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late
        1991.<br />
        It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple
        design of HTML.<br />
        Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by
        SGMLguid, Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.

    <div>
      <p>
        <b>HTML 1.0: The Genesis</b><br /><br />
        The first version, emerged in 1993.<br />
        It laid the foundation for structuring web documents and hyperlinks.<br />
        Although basic by today's standards, it was the spark that ignited the
        digital revolution.<br /><br /><br />
        <b>HTML 2.0: Enhancing Capabilities</b><br /><br />
        Released in 1995, HTML 2.0 introduced forms and tables, <br />
        Expanding the possibilities for web content.<br />
        The ability to interact with web pages marked a significant step
        forward.<br /><br /><br />
        <b>HTML 3.2: Embracing Standardization</b><br /><br />
        With HTML 3.2, standardization became a priority.<br />
        Released in 1997, this version introduced features like frames and
        improved support for web development.<br /><br /><br />
        <b>HTML 4.01: A Time of Refinement</b><br /><br />
        The late '90s brought HTML 4.01, focusing on cleaner code and enhanced
        scripting.<br />
        It introduced style sheets and accessibility features, setting the stage
        for more sophisticated web design.<br /><br /><br />
        <b>XHTML: The Bridge to XML</b><br /><br />
        XHTML, born in the early 2000s, blended the power of HTML with the
        structure of XML.<br />
        It encouraged better code practices, emphasizing the importance of
        well-formed documents.<br /><br /><br />
        <b>HTML5: The Modern Era</b><br /><br />
        HTML5, introduced in 2014, revolutionized web development.<br />
        It brought native multimedia support, improved semantics, and a rich set
        of APIs,<br />
        Making it the go-to choice for building modern, responsive websites and
        web applications.<br /><br /><br /><br />

        As we look ahead, embracing the past while staying attuned to the future
        of HTML is essential.<br />
        It's a journey that promises to keep web development exciting,
        ever-changing, and filled with opportunities for innovation.
